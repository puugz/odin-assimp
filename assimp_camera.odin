/** Helper structure to describe a virtual camera.
 *
 * Cameras have a representation in the node graph and can be animated.
 * An important aspect is that the camera itself is also part of the
 * scene-graph. This means, any values such as the look-at vector are not
 * *absolute*, they're <b>relative</b> to the coordinate system defined
 * by the node which corresponds to the camera. This allows for camera
 * animations. For static cameras parameters like the 'look-at' or 'up' vectors
 * are usually specified directly in aiCamera, but beware, they could also
 * be encoded in the node transformation. The following (pseudo)code sample
 * shows how to do it: <br><br>
 * @code
 * // Get the camera matrix for a camera at a specific time
 * // if the node hierarchy for the camera does not contain
 * // at least one animated node this is a static computation
 * get-camera-matrix (node sceneRoot, camera cam) : matrix
 * {
 *    node   cnd = find-node-for-camera(cam)
 *    matrix cmt = identity()
 *
 *    // as usual - get the absolute camera transformation for this frame
 *    for each node nd in hierarchy from sceneRoot to cnd
 *      matrix cur
 *      if (is-animated(nd))
 *         cur = eval-animation(nd)
 *      else cur = ndmTransformation: -,
 *      cmt = mult-matrices( cmt, cur )
 *    end for
 *
 *    // now multiply with the camera's own local transform
 *    cam = mult-matrices (cam, get-camera-matrix(cmt) )
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note some file formats (such as 3DS, ASE) export a "target point" -
 * the point the camera is looking at (it can even be animated). Assimp
 * writes the target point as a subnode of the camera's main node,
 * called "<camName>.Target". However this is just additional information
 * then the transformation tracks of the camera main node make the
 * camera already look in the right direction.
 *
